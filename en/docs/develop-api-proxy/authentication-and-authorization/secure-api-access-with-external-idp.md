# Secure API Access with an External Key Manager

API security refers to the measures and practices used to protect Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) from potential threats and vulnerabilities. APIs are essential for enabling communication and data exchange between different software applications and services, making them a critical component in modern software development. However, their openness and accessibility can also make them targets for various security risks. Authentication and authorization are key aspects of API security. Authentication is ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access the API. This can involve using API keys, tokens, or more advanced authentication methods like OAuth 2.0. Authorization is controlling what authenticated users or applications are allowed to do within the API. Authorization mechanisms restrict access to specific resources and actions based on user roles or permissions. 

This guide will walk you through setting up Bijira to authenticate API invocations through an external key manager.

This guide walks you through the following steps:

- Create an application in Bijira and enable external key manager authentication.
- Invoke the API.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need to satisfy the following prerequisites:

- [Configure Custom External Key Manager](../../administer/configure-an-external-idp/configure-custom-external-idp.md).
- If you don't already have an API Proxy in Bijira, [create API Proxy](../../create-api-proxy/overview.md).
- Deploy and publish your API. 
- Create an OAuth2 application in your external key manager.

## Step 1: Create an application in Bijira and enable external key manager authentication

Follow the steps below to consume the Bijira API and use an external key manager for authentication:

1. Sign in to your organization in the Bijira Developer Portal at [https://devportal.bijira.dev](https://devportal.bijira.dev).
2. Click **Applications**. and then click **+Create**.
3. Enter a name for the application. 
4. Click **Create**.
5. Click on the newly created application.
6. At the top of the application page, under **OAuth2** click **+ Add Client ID**. 
7. Enter the **Client ID** from the OAuth2 application you created in your external key manager.
8. Click **+Add**.

    !!! note 
        - You can only use the Client ID in one application.
        - This will be visible only to organizations where you have configured external key managers. 

9. Once successfully added, you will be shown a dialog which contains the key manager connection data.
10. You can click on the **Instructions** to view instructions to generate an access token.
11. Click **Subscribe to more APIs** button to explore the APIs and subscribe them through the application.

## Step 2: Invoke the Bijira API

1. On the Bijira Developer Portal, go to your application. 
2. On the top of the page, under **OAuth2**, click **View** to see the **Token Endpoint** URL.
3. Obtain an access token by invoking the token endpoint as follows:

    === "Format"

        ``` sh
        curl -X POST <TOKEN_ENDPOINT> \
            -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
            -d "grant_type=password" \
            -d "username=<USER_NAME>" \
            -d "password=<USER_PASSWORD>" \
            -d "client_id=<OAUTH2_APP_CLIENT_ID>" \
            -d "client_secret=<OAUTH2_APP_CLIENT_SECRET>" \
            -d "scope=<REQUIRED_SCOPES>"
        ```

5. Once you receive the access token, you can [test invoking the resource using cURL](../../test-api-proxy/curl.md) in Bijira.
