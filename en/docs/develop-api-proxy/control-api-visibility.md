# Control API Visibility 

By default, the APIs published in Bijira are visible to anyone who visits the Bijira Developer Portal. By default, Bijira sets the visibility of the API to `Public`. However, developers can control the visibility of their APIs by changing the default option to `Private` or `Restricted`. 

Visibility settings control users from viewing and modifying APIs. API visibility can be one of the following options:

 - **Public** : The API is **visible to all** in the developer portal.

 - **Private** : The API is visible to the **users who only sign in to the Developer Portal**.

 - **Restricted**: The API is **visible to only the user that has the roles that you specify**. This option helps developers to enforce fine-grained access control to the API.

## Change API visibility

1. Sign in to the [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/).
2. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the REST API (Service) for which you want to control API visibility. 
3. In the right section of the API banner, click **Edit** under **API Visibility**.
4. Select the required visibility setting from the **Visibility** list.

         1. To enable fine-grained role-based access control to an API in the Developer Portal, select `Restricted` from the **API visibility** list. Once selected, you will see the roles available in your organization in the **Visible Roles** list. 
         2. Select any combination of roles. Only the users with the given roles can access the APIs through the Dev Portal.
