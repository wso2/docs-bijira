# Audit logs

Audit logs, also called audit trails, enhance security, ensure compliance, provide operational insights, and help manage risks. 

In Bijira, an audit log records organization-level user-specific operations performed via the Bijira Console. It also captures the timestamp and the outcome of the action. 

As of now, Bijira captures the following user-specific operations as audit logs:

- Project creation, update, and deletion.
- API Proxy creation, update, and deletion.
- API Proxy promotion initiation.
- API Proxy version creation.
<!-- - Component deployment, redeployment, and undeployment initiation for all components other than REST API Proxy components. -->
<!-- - Component API access mode update. -->
<!-- - Enabling and disabling component auto-deployment on commit.  -->
<!-- - Component build configuration update. -->
<!-- - Component endpoint creation, update, and deletion. -->
- Organization user management.
- On-premises key management.
- Project-level configuration management.

In Bijira, organization administrators are allowed to view audit logs by default. If other members need to access organization-specific audit logs, the administrator can create a role with the relevant permission and assign it to members. For step-by-step instructions on how to create and assign a role with relevant permission, see [Manage audit log access](#manage-audit-log-access).

To view audit logs, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Bijira](https://console.bijira.dev/).
2. In the Bijira Console, go to the top navigation menu and click **Organization**.
   
    !!! tip
         As of now, you can only view organization-level audit logs.

3. In the left navigation menu, click **Admin** and then click **Audit Logs**. This displays audit logs for the past 30 days by default.

    To view audit logs based on a specific time range and other requirements, you can apply the necessary filter criteria.

## Audit log retention

Bijira retains audit logs for one year and archives them for an additional year. Therefore, the total retention period for audit logs is two years.
