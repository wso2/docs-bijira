# Analytics

## Overview

The Analytics feature enables the API Platform to capture, process, and publish API request and response data for observability and business insights. Analytics data is collected asynchronously from the gateway without impacting request latency and is published to an external analytics platform for further analysis and visualization.

This capability allows platform administrators and business stakeholders to gain visibility into API usage patterns, traffic behavior, latency characteristics, and consumer activity across the platform.


## Features

* Asynchronous collection of API request and response data
* Policy-enriched analytics metadata capture
* Zero impact on request/response latency
* Batched and configurable publishing to external analytics platforms
* Horizontally scalable analytics processing pipeline
* Pluggable publisher model (supports multiple analytics backends)


## Prerequisites

 - Active Moesif Account and an Application ID
> **Note:** For obtaining the Application ID:
> - Step 1: Sign up in [Moesif](https://www.moesif.com/)
> - Sept 2: Follow the onboarding wizard.
> - Sept 3: During the sign up process, you will receive a Collector Application ID for your configured application. Copy this value and keep it saved.

> For more detailed instructions and advanced configuration options, refer to the [official Moesif Documentation](https://www.moesif.com/docs).


## Configuration

Analytics is configured entirely through the gateway `config.toml` file and is enabled at a system level.

#### Publishers

| Parameter              | Type    | Required | Description                               |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `type`                 | string  | Yes      | Analytics publisher type (Currently limited only to ```moesif``` )                  |

#### gRPC Event Server

This section configures both the Envoy access log streaming settings and the ALS (Access Log Service) server that receives those logs. The ALS server runs within the policy-engine component.

| Parameter               | Type     | Required | Default | Description                      |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- |---- | -------------------------------- |
| `buffer_flush_interval` | duration | No       | `1000000000`| Maximum time Envoy waits(in nanoseconds) before flushing buffered access log entries.|
| `buffer_size_bytes`     | int      | No       | `16384` | Maximum size of the in-memory buffer used to batch access log entries before sending them to ALS server.                  |
| `grpc_request_timeout`  | duration | No       | `20000000000` | Timeout duration Envoy waits(in nanoseconds) for a response from the ALS server before considering the log delivery attempt failed.            |
| `server_port`           | int     | Yes      | - | gRPC port on which the ALS server listens for incoming access log streams from Envoy.      |
| `shutdown_timeout`      | int     | No       | `600` | Maximum time allowed for the ALS server to gracefully shut down while completing in-flight log processing(in seconds). |
| `als_plain_text`        | boolean | No       | `true` | Use plaintext gRPC        |
| `public_key_path`       | string | No       | - | Path to the public key used for securing ALS communication when transport-level encryption or authentication is enabled.        |
| `private_key_path`      | string | No       | - | Path to the private key used for securing ALS communication when transport-level encryption or authentication is enabled.        |
| `max_message_size`      | int     | No       | `1000000000` |Maximum size of a single gRPC message that the ALS server is allowed to receive from Envoy.      |
| `max_header_limit`      | int     | No       | `8192` | Maximum allowed size of request or response headers processed by the ALS server      |

**Note:** The hostname for the ALS connection is automatically derived from the policy-engine configuration. The internal log name identifier is set to `"envoy_access_log"` and is not configurable.


## Configuration Examples

#### Integrate Moesif Publisher

For Moesif analytics integration, the following publisher-specific attributes must be configured under the `settings` section. These parameters control authentication, batching behavior, and publish intervals for efficient analytics delivery. The required attributes are as follows.

| Parameter              | Type    | Required | Description                               |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `application_id`       | string  | Yes      | Analytics platform application identifier |
| `publish_interval`     | int     | Yes       | Interval (seconds) between publish cycles |
| `event_queue_size`     | int     | Yes       | Maximum events held in memory             |
| `batch_size`           | int     | Yes       | Maximum events per batch                  |
| `timer_wakeup_seconds` | int     | Yes       | Publisher timer resolution                |


```toml

enabled = true

[[analytics.publishers]]
type = "moesif"

event_queue_size = 10000
batch_size = 50
timer_wakeup_seconds = 3

[analytics.grpc_event_server]
buffer_flush_interval = 1000000000
buffer_size_bytes = 16384
grpc_request_timeout = 20000000000
server_port = 18090
shutdown_timeout = 600
als_plain_text = true
max_message_size = 1000000000
