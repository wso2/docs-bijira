# Publish APIs on a Self-Hosted Gateway

After you create and deploy an API proxy to a **Self-Hosted Gateway**, you can make consumers aware of it by moving the API through the lifecycle and publishing it. Publishing updates the API lifecycle to **Published** so it can appear in the API Platform Developer Portal and be invoked according to how access is configured.

This section describes two ways to expose published APIs:

| Approach | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| [**Subscription-less APIs**](subscription-less-apis.md) | Published APIs for which consumers are **not** required to subscribe to a subscription plan in the Developer Portal. |
| [**Subscription-based APIs**](subscription-based-apis.md) | Published APIs that have **subscription plans** assigned; consumers choose a plan and subscribe to generate Subscription Token. |

Both approaches use the same high-level flow in the console: deploy the API to your gateway, then use **Manage** → **Lifecycle** to **Publish** the API when it is ready.

!!! note
    Self-hosted gateway support for creating and routing traffic to APIs follows the same REST proxy constraints described in [Getting Started with Self-Hosted Gateway](../getting-started.md). Publishing and subscription behavior on the gateway is aligned with organization-level subscription plans configuration.
