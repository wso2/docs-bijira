# Getting Started with API Monetization

To enable API monetization, you need to connect your Stripe account to API Platform. Once connected, API Platform creates Stripe products, prices, customers, and subscriptions on your behalf, and reports usage to Stripe for billing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account
- Admin access to your API Platform organization
- Your Stripe **Publishable Key** and a **Secret Key** (available in the Stripe Dashboard under **Developers > API Keys**. For more details, see the [Stripe API keys documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)).

    You can use either of the following options for the secret key:

    - A **Standard secret key**, which has full access to your Stripe account, or
    - A **Restricted secret key**, which scopes access to only the permissions you grant. If you choose this option, make sure the key is granted the permissions listed below.
