# Insights

The AI Workspace provides a built-in **Insights** page that gives you real-time visibility into traffic, usage patterns, and performance across your LLM Providers and Proxies. Insights are powered by [Moesif](https://www.moesif.com/), an AI-native API analytics platform, and are available directly within the AI Workspace — no separate Moesif setup is required.

## Accessing Insights

1. Navigate to **AI Workspace** in your Bijira dashboard.
2. Click **Insights** in the left navigation sidebar.

The Insights page loads an embedded analytics dashboard scoped to your AI Workspace activity.

## What You Can See

### Overview Summary

The overview panel at the top shows key metrics at a glance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Requests** | The total number of requests processed through your LLM Proxies. |
| **Avg Latency** | The average end-to-end response latency across all requests. |
| **Success Rate** | The percentage of requests that completed successfully (non-error responses). |

### Request Trend

A time-series chart showing the volume of requests over time. Use this to identify traffic spikes, usage patterns, and the impact of configuration changes on request volume.

### Traffic Split

A breakdown of traffic distribution across your LLM Proxies or providers. Use this to understand which proxies or providers are handling the most load and whether traffic is distributed as expected.

### Full Analytics Dashboard

The full Moesif-powered dashboard embedded in the Insights page provides deeper analytics, including:

- **Request logs** — Inspect individual API calls, their payloads, status codes, and latencies.
- **Filtering and segmentation** — Slice data by proxy, provider, endpoint, consumer, or time range.
- **Token usage trends** — Track prompt, completion, and total token consumption over time.
- **Error analysis** — Identify error patterns and guardrail interventions.
- **Consumer activity** — Monitor which applications or consumers are generating the most traffic.

## Using Insights for Cost and Rate Limit Management

The Insights dashboard is particularly useful for tuning your [token-based rate limits](policies/guardrails/token-based-rate-limit.md):

1. Use **token usage trends** to understand actual consumption patterns before setting rate limits.
2. Check **per-consumer traffic** to determine appropriate per-consumer limits.
3. Monitor **error rates** to detect rate limit violations (`429 Too Many Requests` responses) and adjust limits accordingly.

## Using Insights for Guardrail Monitoring

When guardrails are active, you can use Insights to:

- Track how often guardrails are intervening (guardrail intervention responses appear as `422` errors).
- Identify which endpoints or consumers are triggering the most interventions.
- Validate that newly configured guardrails are behaving as expected.

See [Guardrails Overview](policies/guardrails/overview.md) for more on configuring guardrails.
