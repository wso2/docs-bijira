# Semantic Cache

The Semantic Cache policy caches LLM responses and serves them for semantically similar future requests — without calling the upstream LLM. Unlike exact-match caching, it uses vector embeddings and cosine similarity to recognize requests that ask essentially the same question with different wording.

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    Before using this policy, the embedding provider and vector database must be configured in the gateway's `config.toml`. The policy UI only exposes the similarity threshold and JSON path — all embedding and database connection details are system-level settings.

    See [Gateway Configuration](#gateway-configuration) below for the required `config.toml` settings.

## How It Works

1. An incoming request arrives. The policy extracts the relevant text (full payload or a JSONPath-specified field).
2. The embedding provider converts the text into a vector.
3. The vector database is searched for a cached entry with a cosine similarity score at or above the configured **Similarity Threshold**.
4. **Cache hit** — The cached response is returned immediately with an `X-Cache-Status: HIT` header. The upstream LLM is not called.
5. **Cache miss** — The request is forwarded to the upstream LLM. A successful (`200`) response is stored in the vector database for future reuse.

If the embedding service or vector database is unreachable, the policy fails open — the request proceeds to the upstream LLM as normal.

## Configuration Parameters

These are the parameters configurable from the policy UI when adding the guardrail:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Similarity Threshold** | Yes | Cosine similarity score (0.0–1.0) above which a cached response is returned. Recommended starting value: `0.85`. |
| **JSON Path** | No | A JSONPath expression to extract the text to embed from the request body (e.g., `$.messages[0].content`). If not set, the entire request payload is embedded. |

## Gateway Configuration

The embedding provider and vector database are configured in the gateway's `config.toml` file. These settings apply as defaults to all Semantic Cache policy instances.

```toml
embedding_provider = "OPENAI"            # Supported: OPENAI, MISTRAL, AZURE_OPENAI
embedding_provider_endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings"
embedding_provider_model = "text-embedding-3-small"
embedding_provider_dimension = 1536
embedding_provider_api_key = ""

vector_db_provider = "REDIS"             # Supported: REDIS, MILVUS
vector_db_provider_host = "redis"
vector_db_provider_port = 6379
vector_db_provider_database = "0"
vector_db_provider_username = "default"
vector_db_provider_password = "default"
vector_db_provider_ttl = 3600
```

### Supported Embedding Providers

| Provider | `embedding_provider` value | Example endpoint | Dimension |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI` | `https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings` | `1536` (`text-embedding-3-small`) |
| Mistral AI | `MISTRAL` | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/embeddings` | `1024` (`mistral-embed`) |
| Azure OpenAI | `AZURE_OPENAI` | Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL | Depends on deployment |

### Supported Vector Databases

| Provider | `vector_db_provider` value | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| Redis | `REDIS` | Requires [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/) module |
| Milvus | `MILVUS` | Better suited for large-scale deployments (>1M vectors) |

## Add This Policy

1. Configure the embedding provider and vector database in `config.toml` and restart the gateway.
2. Navigate to **AI Workspace** > **LLM Providers** or **LLM Proxies**.
3. Click on the provider or proxy name.
4. Go to the **Guardrails** tab.
5. Click **+ Add Guardrail** and select **Semantic Cache** from the sidebar.
6. Set the **Similarity Threshold**.
7. Optionally set a **JSON Path** under **Advanced Settings**.
8. Click **Add** (for providers) or **Submit** (for proxies).
9. Deploy the provider or proxy to apply the changes.

## Choosing a Similarity Threshold

| Threshold | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **0.95–1.0** | Very strict — only near-identical questions return cached responses |
| **0.85–0.94** | Recommended for most use cases — catches semantically equivalent questions with some wording variation |
| **0.75–0.84** | More flexible — useful for broader conceptual similarity |
| **Below 0.75** | Not recommended — risk of returning cached responses for unrelated questions |

Start at `0.85` and adjust based on observed cache hit rates and response relevance.

## Performance Notes

- Embedding generation adds approximately 100–500ms to each request. This is typically offset by the 1–5 second savings on cache hits.
- Redis (with RediSearch) is suited for smaller datasets (under 1M cached vectors). Milvus is optimized for larger-scale deployments.
- Only `200` responses from the upstream LLM are cached.
- Cache entries are scoped per route to prevent cross-contamination between different APIs.
