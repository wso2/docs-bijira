## Access Provider Details

1. Navigate to **AI Workspace** > **LLM Providers**.

2. Click on a provider name to open its details page.

The provider details page shows:

- Provider name, version, and template type
- Creation and last updated timestamps  
- Six management tabs (Connection, Access Control, Security, Rate Limiting, Guardrails, Models)
- **Deploy to Gateway** button in the top right

## Connection

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Manage upstream endpoint configuration and authentication credentials for the LLM provider.

</div>

### Provider Endpoint

**Upstream URL** - Where API requests are forwarded to:

| Provider Type | URL Configuration |
|---------------|-------------------|
| OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral AI | Pre-configured (read-only) |
| Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry | Custom URL (editable) |

**To update:**

1. Modify the **Provider Endpoint** field
2. Click **Save**

### Authentication

Configure how the gateway authenticates with the upstream provider:

- **Authentication Type**: Usually `api-key` (set by template)
- **Credentials**: Your provider API key
    - Click the 👁️ icon to show/hide the value
    - Update and click **Save** to change credentials

### OpenAPI Specification

**Spec URL** - The OpenAPI specification for importing API resources:

- Can be a URL or file upload
- Automatically populates the Access Control resources list
- Re-import to refresh available endpoints

---

## Access Control

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Control which API endpoints are available through this provider. Also referred to as the Resources tab.

</div>

### Import API Specification

The provider's OpenAPI spec defines available endpoints:

1. Spec is automatically loaded from the provider template
2. Click **Import Specification** to manually import or refresh
3. All API paths and methods are extracted and listed

### Enable/Disable Resources

Control endpoint availability:

- **Toggle switches**: Enable/disable individual resources
- **Effect**: Disabled resources are blocked at the gateway
- **Apply**: Changes take effect after redeploying the provider

---

## Security

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Configure how applications authenticate when accessing this provider through the gateway.

</div>

### API Key Authentication

Set up the API key that client applications must provide:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Authentication Type** | Authentication method | `apiKey` (default) |
| **API Key Name** | Header or query parameter name | `x-api-key`, `apikey`, `Authorization` |
| **Key Location** | Where clients send the key | `Header` (recommended) or `Query` |

**To configure:**

1. Select **Authentication Type**: `apiKey`
2. Enter **API Key Name** that applications will use
3. Choose **Key Location**:
    - **Header** - Sent in HTTP request header (most secure)
    - **Query** - Sent as URL query parameter (less secure)
4. Click **Save**

---

## Rate Limiting

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Control request and token consumption to prevent cost overruns and ensure fair usage across all consumers.

</div>

The Rate Limiting tab provides two independent sections: **Backend** and **Per Consumer**.

| Section | Controls | Protects | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Backend** | Requests from the gateway to the upstream LLM provider | Your provider API credentials and total spend | Available |
| **Per Consumer** | Requests from client applications to the gateway | Fair usage across all consumers | *Coming soon* |

!!! info "Per Consumer Rate Limiting — Coming Soon"
    Per consumer rate limiting is not yet available. Only the **Backend** section is currently configurable.

Both sections support two configuration modes:

- **Provider-wide** — A single limit applied across all API endpoints.
- **Per Resource** — Individual limits per API endpoint (e.g., chat completions vs. embeddings).

!!! note
    Provider-wide and Per Resource modes are mutually exclusive per section. Clear existing limits before switching modes.

### Limit Criteria

Each section lets you configure:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Request Count** | Maximum number of requests within the reset duration |
| **Token Count** | Maximum number of tokens (prompt + completion) within the reset duration |
| **Cost** | Cost-based limiting *(Coming soon)* |

For each enabled criterion, set the **Quota** and **Reset Duration** (`second`, `minute`, `hour`, or `all`).

### Provider-wide Configuration

1. Select **Provider-wide** in the Backend section.
2. Enable **Request Count** and/or **Token Count**.
3. Enter the **Quota** and select the **Reset Duration** for each criterion.
4. Click **Save**.

### Per Resource Configuration

1. Select **Per Resource** in the Backend section.
2. Expand **Limit per Resource** to set default limits for all endpoints:
    - Enable the criteria and configure **Quota** and **Reset Duration**.
3. To override limits for a specific endpoint, expand that resource row and configure it separately.
4. Click **Save**.

!!! tip "Cost Control Best Practices"
    Set conservative backend limits first to protect your provider credentials. Monitor actual usage via the Insights dashboard before increasing limits. Use Per Resource mode only when endpoints have significantly different usage patterns.

## Guardrails

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #F44336; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Attach guardrails to enforce content safety, compliance, and quality standards. Guardrails on a provider can be applied globally (all endpoints) or per resource (specific endpoints), and affect all proxies that use this provider.

</div>

### View Attached Guardrails

The tab displays all guardrails currently attached to the provider:

- **Guardrail name** and type
- **Configuration status** and parameters
- **Enable/disable toggles** for quick activation control

### Add a Guardrail

Guardrails can be added globally (applying to all endpoints) or per resource (applying to a specific endpoint).

**To add a global guardrail:**

1. In the **Global Guardrails** section, click **+ Add Guardrail**.
2. A sidebar opens showing available guardrail types.
3. Select a guardrail and configure its settings:
    - Fill in required parameters
    - Expand **Advanced Settings** for additional options
4. Click **Add** to attach it to the provider.

**To add a resource-level guardrail:**

1. Find the resource you want to protect and expand its card.
2. Click **+ Add Guardrail** within that resource.
3. Select and configure the guardrail (same process as global guardrails).
4. Click **Add** to attach it to the resource.

### Configure Guardrails

Guardrail parameters cannot be edited in place. To change a guardrail's configuration, you must delete it and add it again with the updated settings.

**To update a guardrail:**

1. Delete the existing guardrail.
2. Click **+ Add Guardrail** and re-add it with the updated configuration.
3. Redeploy the provider to apply the changes.

!!! tip "Advanced Settings"
    Each guardrail includes advanced configuration options such as custom thresholds, severity levels, and execution phases. Click **Advanced Settings** when adding a guardrail.

!!! warning "Production Impact"
    Guardrail changes require a manual redeploy to take effect on deployed gateways. Test thoroughly in a non-production environment before enabling strict guardrails.
