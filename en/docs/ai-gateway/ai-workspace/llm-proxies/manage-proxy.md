# Manage LLM Proxy

Once you create an LLM proxy, you can manage its configuration through the proxy details page. This guide covers all management operations available for your proxy.

!!! info "On This Page"
    **Proxy Configuration:**

    - [Provider Settings](#provider-settings) - LLM service provider and authentication
    - [Resources](#resources) - OpenAPI specification and endpoints
    - [Security](#security) - Client application authentication
    - [Guardrails](#guardrails) - Content protection and policies
    - [Get Started](#get-started) - API keys and gateway deployments

    **Lifecycle Operations:**

    - [Save Changes](#save-changes) - Apply configuration updates
    - [Delete Proxy](#delete-proxy) - Remove proxy permanently

---

## Access Proxy Details

1. Navigate to **LLM** > **Proxies** in the left navigation menu.

2. Click on a proxy name to open its details page.

The proxy details page displays the following information at the top:

- **Proxy name** (e.g., Test-Openai)
- **Provider** - The linked LLM service provider
- **Version** - The proxy version
- **Last updated** - Timestamp of the most recent change

The page is organized into four configuration tabs: **Provider**, **Resources**, **Security**, and **Guardrails**. On the right side, you'll find the **Get Started** panel with API key generation and deployed gateway information.

The **Deploy to Gateway** button and a **delete** icon are located in the top-right corner of the page.

---

## Provider Settings

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #1976d2; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Configure which LLM service provider the proxy connects to and how it authenticates with the provider.

</div>

### LLM Service Provider

1. Go to the **Provider** tab.

2. Use the **Provider** dropdown to select or change the linked LLM service provider.

    The dropdown lists all service providers that have been configured in your workspace.

    !!! info
        Changing the provider updates related settings such as authentication and available resources.

### API Key Configuration

If your selected provider uses API key authentication, you'll see the **API Key Configuration** section below the provider dropdown.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Header Name** | The authentication header required by the provider (e.g., `X-API-Key`). This field is read-only and is defined by the provider template. |
| **API Key** | Enter your provider's API key in this field. |

**To configure:**

1. Enter the API key in the **API Key** field.
2. Click **Save API Key** to store the credential securely.

!!! warning "Security Best Practices"
    - API keys are encrypted and stored securely
    - Keys are not displayed after saving
    - Store a backup copy in a secure location
    - Rotate keys regularly for security

---

## Resources

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #388e3c; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Define which API endpoints (resources) are available through this proxy by importing an OpenAPI specification.

</div>

### OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification defines the resources (API endpoints) available through your proxy. Depending on the provider, the specification may be automatically populated.

**To import manually:**

1. Go to the **Resources** tab.

2. Click the **Import from file** button.

3. Upload a JSON or YAML file containing your OpenAPI specification.

4. The proxy automatically parses the file and displays the extracted resources.

!!! tip "OpenAPI Format"
    Supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications in both JSON and YAML formats.

### View Resources

After importing, the **Resources** section displays the count and list of parsed resources. Each resource shows:

- **HTTP Method** - The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Resource Path** - The endpoint path (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Description** - A description extracted from the OpenAPI spec

---

## Security

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #f57c00; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Configure how client applications authenticate when accessing your proxy endpoints.

</div>

### Authentication

1. Go to the **Security** tab.

2. Configure the following authentication settings:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Authentication type** | Select the authentication method from the dropdown. Currently, **API Key** is available. |
| **Key name** | The name of the key that clients must provide (e.g., `X-API-Key`). |
| **Sent in** | Choose how clients send the authentication key: **Header** (recommended) or **Query Parameter**. |

3. Click **Save** to apply the security configuration.

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    Use **Header** authentication for production environments. Query parameters may be logged in server access logs and browser history.

---

## Guardrails

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;" markdown>

Attach and configure guardrails to enforce content safety, compliance, and quality standards. This works similarly to how guardrails are configured for [LLM providers](../llm-providers/manage-provider.md#guardrails).

</div>

### Global Guardrails

Global guardrails apply to **all resources** in the proxy.

**To add a global guardrail:**

1. Go to the **Guardrails** tab.

2. In the **Global Guardrails** section, click **+ Add Guardrail**.

3. A right-side panel opens displaying the available guardrails and policies.

4. Select a guardrail from the list.

5. Configure the guardrail settings including version, parameters, and any advanced settings.

6. Click **Submit** to add the guardrail.

Added guardrails appear as pills showing the guardrail name and version.

### Resource-wise Guardrails

Resource-wise guardrails apply to **specific endpoints** only. This section lists each resource from your OpenAPI specification, allowing you to attach guardrails to individual endpoints.

**To add a resource-specific guardrail:**

1. In the **Resource-wise Guardrails** section, find the resource you want to protect.

2. Expand the resource card and click **+ Add Guardrail**.

3. Select and configure the guardrail (same process as global guardrails).

4. Click **Submit** to attach the guardrail to the resource.

!!! note
    If no resources have been imported in the Resources tab, the Resource-wise Guardrails section will display: *No resources available.*

### Guardrail Scope

Understanding how guardrails are applied:

| Scope | Applies To | Use Case |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Global** | All proxy endpoints | Organization-wide policies (e.g., PII masking, content filters) |
| **Resource-specific** | A single endpoint | Endpoint-specific rules (e.g., rate limits, content length) |

!!! tip "Mixing Scopes"
    You can combine global and resource-specific guardrails. Global guardrails apply first to all requests, and resource-specific guardrails add additional protection for specific endpoints. This provides layered defense for sensitive operations.

### Manage Guardrails

- **View**: Global guardrails appear as pills in the Global Guardrails section. Resource-specific guardrails appear under each resource card.
- **Remove**: Click the **×** icon on a guardrail pill to remove it.

!!! warning
    Removing a guardrail takes effect after saving. Ensure no active applications depend on the guardrail's protection.

!!! info
    Learn more about available guardrails in the [Guardrails Overview](../policies/guardrails/overview.md). For the full list of policies and their specifications, visit the [Policy Hub](https://wso2.com/api-platform/policy-hub/).

## Get Started

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #7b1fa2; padding-left: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

The Get Started panel on the right side of the proxy details page provides quick access to API key generation and deployment information.

</div>

### Invoke URL

The **Invoke URL** shows the base URL for calling this proxy through a specific gateway. Select a gateway from the dropdown to see its URL.

The URL follows the format:

```
https://{gateway-host}/{proxy-name}
```

To call a specific resource, append the resource path:

```
https://{gateway-host}/{proxy-name}/chat/completions
```

The proxy URL is independent of the provider URL — the provider's vhost is not part of the proxy path.

### LLM Proxy Keys

Generate API keys to authenticate requests to your deployed gateways.

1. Click **Generate API Key** in the Get Started panel.

2. The generated API key is displayed in a success notification with a copy button.

3. Copy and save your API key immediately.

!!! danger "Important"
    API keys are only displayed once at generation time. For security reasons, you won't be able to see the key again after navigating away. Store it in a secure location immediately.

### Deployed Gateways

The **Deployed Gateways** section shows the gateways where your proxy is currently deployed. Each gateway entry displays:

- **Gateway name** 
- **Deployment status** - Active or Not Active
- **Deployment identifier** 

---

## Save Changes

After making configuration changes across any tab (Provider, Resources, Security, Guardrails), click the **Save** button at the bottom-right of the page to persist your changes.

Use the **Cancel** button to discard all unsaved changes and revert to the last saved state.

!!! info
    Configuration changes take effect immediately on all deployed gateways after saving.

---

## Delete Proxy

To delete a proxy, click the **delete** icon (trash icon) in the top-right corner of the proxy details page, next to the Deploy to Gateway button.

!!! danger "Irreversible Action"
    Deleting a proxy is permanent and cannot be undone.

    - The proxy is immediately removed from all gateways
    - All generated API keys stop working
    - All configuration (resources, security, guardrails) is deleted

!!! warning "Before Deleting"
    - Ensure no applications are actively using the proxy
    - Back up any important configuration settings
    - Notify teams that depend on the proxy endpoints
