# Govern API Proxies

To govern the API proxies, you can define rulesets/documents, and policies. These concepts help you enforce governance policies on APIs and ensure compliance with security, compliance, performance, and operational guidelines.

To define the governance compliance standards for API proxies, you can either create Spectral rulesets or use the natural language specification to define the rules.

## Create a Ruleset

1. Sign in to the [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/).
2. In the Bijira Console header, go to the **Organization** list and select your organization.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Admin** and then click **Governance**. This opens the Governance page.
4. From the Rulesets / Documents section, select Rulesets and click **Add Rulesets** button.
