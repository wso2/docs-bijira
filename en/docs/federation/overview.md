# Gateway Federation in Bijira

## What is Gateway Federation?

## Gateway Federation Overview

Gateway federation in Bijira empowers organizations to seamlessly manage, govern, and expose APIs deployed on external gateways, all from a single, unified control plane. Instead of manually tracking APIs across different platforms, Bijira enables you to:

- **Discover External APIs:** Automatically find APIs hosted on external gateways and bring them under Bijira’s management.
- **Centralize Governance:** Apply consistent API governance compliance policies to all federated APIs, regardless of where they are deployed.
- **Monitor & Enforce Compliance:** Continuously monitor API activity and ensure adherence to organizational governance policies.
- **Enable Developer Access:** Make APIs easily discoverable and consumable for developers through the Bijira Developer Portal, streamlining onboarding and integration.

By federating gateways with Bijira, you gain complete visibility and control over your API landscape, reduce operational complexity, and accelerate secure API delivery to consumers and partners.

## Getting Started
