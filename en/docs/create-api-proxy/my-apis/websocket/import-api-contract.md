# Import API Contract

A WebSocket API proxy operates based on the WebSocket protocol specification (RFC 6455). This protocol is designed to overcome the limitations of the traditional HTTP request-response model by establishing a single, persistent TCP connection between the client and the server.

The WebSocket connection begins with an initial handshake that leverages the HTTP Upgrade mechanism. Once established, this connection supports full-duplex communication, enabling continuous, low-latency, and simultaneous two-way data exchange. This feature makes it ideal for real-time applications such as live data feeds, gaming, and chat services.

In this guide, you will:

- Create a WebSocket API proxy.
- Configure and Deploy the API proxy.
- Test the API proxy to verify its functionality.

## Prerequisites

- If you're signing in to the Bijira Console for the first time, create an organization:
    1. Go to [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/) and sign in using your preferred method.
    2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
    4. Click **Create**.

  This creates the organization and opens the **Project Home** page of the default project created for you.

## Create an API Proxy

In this guide, you will specify a URL to an AsyncAPI definition of a sample API to create a WebSocket API proxy.

1. Go to [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/) and sign in. This opens the project home page.
2. If you already have one or more components in your project, click + Create. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
3. Select **Import API Contract**.
4. Select the API Type as **WebSocket**.
5. Select **URL** option and provide the following URL to import the API contract from the GitHub repository:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wso2/bijira-samples/refs/heads/main/chat-service-api/asyncapi.yaml   
   ```

5. Click **Next** and edit pre-defined values as needed. You can keep the default values for this sample.
6. Click **Create** to create the API Proxy. Wait for the setup to complete.

## Configure and Deploy the API Proxy

1. Navigate to the **Deploy** page of the API Proxy.
2. Select **Configure and Deploy** option from the **Deploy** dropdown and click it.
3. Select **External** as API Access Mode.
4. Click **Deploy**.

## Test the API Proxy

1. Navigate to the **Test --> Console** page of the API Proxy.
2. Use the Console to test the API Proxy.

## Promote the API Proxy to Production and Publish the API proxy

1. Navigate to the **Deploy** page of the API Proxy.
2. Click **Promote**. This promotes the API proxy from the Development environment to the Production environment.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Lifecycle** under **Develop**. This takes you to the **Lifecycle** page.
4. Click **Publish**.
5. In the **Publish API** dialog, click **Confirm** to proceed with publishing the API. If you want to change the display name, make the necessary changes and then click **Confirm**. This sets the API lifecycle state to **Published**.

## API Proxy Behavior

This Chat Service API Proxy enables clients to establish persistent connections with the server, allowing multiple users to connect simultaneously and exchange real-time messages. It also supports broadcasting messages to all users participating in the chat.
