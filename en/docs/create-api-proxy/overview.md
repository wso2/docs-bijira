# Overview

Bijira API Manager allows you to create API proxies that can be used to secure, protect, and manage access to your APIs. You can create an API proxy by defining a set of policies and behaviors that control how the API proxy interacts with the backend service.

An API proxy can be used to expose an existing API which is hosted in same organization or a third party API.

Creating an **API proxy** for:

- **My APIs(Ingress APIs)**
  
    An API Proxy can be created to front an existing ingress api in following scenarios:

    - [Import API Contract](my-apis/import-api-contract.md)
    - [Start with Endpoint](my-apis/start-with-endpoint.md)
    - [Start from Scratch](my-apis/start-from-scratch.md)   
    - [Create with GenAI](my-apis/create-with-genai.md)

- **Third Party APIs(Egress APIs)**

    An API Proxy can be created to front an Endpoint or API which is managed by a third party in following scenarios:

    - [Get from Marketplace](third-party-apis/get-from-marketplace.md)
    - [Import API Contract](third-party-apis/import-api-contract.md)
