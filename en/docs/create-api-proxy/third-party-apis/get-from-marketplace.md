# Creating an API Proxy from Marketplace

Bijira provides built-in support for multiple well-known third-party APIs through the Bijira Marketplace. The marketplace contains API contracts for these third-party services, allowing you to create and publish API proxies effortlessly.

## Steps to Create an API Proxy from the Marketplace

Follow these steps to create an API proxy for a third-party API available in the Bijira Marketplace:

### 1. Access the Bijira Console

1. Sign in to the [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/) and select your project.

### 2. Select a Third-Party API

1. Click **+Create**.
2. Navigate to **Create an API Proxy for Third-Party APIs (Egress)** and click **Get From Marketplace**.
3. In the **Create API Proxy from Marketplace** page, browse or search for the desired third-party API.
4. Select the API you want to integrate.

### 3. Configure API Proxy Details

1. Update the required API proxy details, such as:
    - API Name
    - Identifier
    - Version
    - Target
2. Review and confirm the configuration settings.

3. Click **Create** to finalize the API proxy creation.

   Once created, the overview page of the new API proxy appears.

### 4. Configure Backend Settings

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.
2. Depending on the third-party API requirements, configure **Endpoint Configurations** or set up an **API-level mediation policy** to handle authentication and authorization.

#### Example: Configuring the `Currency API`

To integrate the `Currency API`, follow these steps:

1. In the **Policy** page, click **Endpoint Configuration** under **Service Contract**.
2. Click **Configure**.
3. Enter the required authentication details:
    - **API Key Header**
    - **API Key**

4. Click **Save** to apply the configuration.

### Next Steps

- Test the API proxy to ensure it correctly forwards requests to the third-party API. See [Test REST Endpoints via the OpenAPI Console](../../test-api-proxy/openapi-console.md).
- Apply additional policies if needed (e.g., rate limiting, security policies). See [Policy Overview](../../develop-api-proxy/policy/policy-overview.md).
- Publish the API for consumers.  See [Lifecycle Management](../../develop-api-proxy/lifecycle-management.md).

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate third-party APIs into your Bijira environment and manage them efficiently.
