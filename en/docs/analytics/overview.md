Moesif Basic provides a frictionless and integrated API analytics experience in WSO2 API Platform at no additional expense under your current WSO2 subscription. Without any complex setup or instrumentation, you get real-time observability and telemetry across heterogeneous API environments. You can leverage this unified telemetry plane to monitor traffic, audit system behaviors, diagnose infrastructure latencies, and more. WSO2 gateways directly integrate with and route telemetry to Moesif, helping enterprise architects eliminate the overhead associated with constructing bespoke analytical pipelines.

This document describes the setup processes and the available features to help you get started with Moesif in WSO2 API Platform. 

## Setup and access configurations

Moesif is available in: 

* SaaS/cloud-managed endpoints in WSO2 API Platform Cloud  
* Self-managed, hybrid deployments using the self-hosted API Platform Gateway and API Manager

### SaaS control plane in WSO2 API Platform Cloud

For managed SaaS environments, setup is executed entirely through the cloud Console.

When you create an organization using the Console, you can start using Moesif Basic right away without any additional steps. To access it, from the organization or project view in the Console, select **Insights** and then **API Insights** in the navigation menu.

If you have a separate Moesif account or subscription, you can integrate it from the Console through these steps:

1. In the organization view, select **Admin** and then select **Settings**.  
   2. Go to the **Moesif Dashboard** tab and enable Moesif API analytics for the organization.  
   3. In the advanced settings, specify the desired environment type and paste your Moesif Application ID.  
   4. Select Add.

You can always access the Application ID any time by following these steps after logging into [Moesif Portal](https://moesif.com/wrap):

1. Select the account icon to bring up the settings menu.  
2. Select **Installation** or **API Keys**.  
3. Copy your Moesif Application ID from the **Collector Application ID** field.

### Self-Hosted Platform Gateway (WSO2 API Platform)

For self-hosted Platform API and AI gateways, follow these instructions:

* [Moesif Analytics in API Gateway](https://wso2.com/api-platform/docs/api-gateway/analytics/moesif-analytics/)  
* [Moesif Analytics in AI Gateway](https://wso2.com/api-platform/docs/ai-gateway/analytics/moesif-analytics/) 

### Self-Managed WSO2 API Manager

Follow the instructions in [Moesif Analytics Integration in API Manager docs](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/monitoring/api-analytics/moesif-analytics/moesif-integration-guide/).

## How to Use Moesif Basic 

Moesif Basic provides real-time traffic observability, automated email alerting, and highly optimized analytics panels accessible directly from the API Platform Cloud Console and API Manager Publisher Portal.

### Real-Time Alerts

You can define static, threshold-based alerts for real-time monitoring of critical metrics.

Creating an alert rule involves specifying the following:

* The API   
* The metric to observe  
* The threshold value of the metric that triggers the alert  
* The email notification channel to receive alerts

Alerts notify automatically to the configured email address when API exceeds a specified threshold of a metric; for example, too many 400 Bad Request errors or when 90th percentile latency exceeds 10 seconds. 

You can access details about existing alert rules any time as well as the history of triggered alerts. The preserved history helps you track incident patterns over time.

### Real-Time Analytics Dashboards 

Moesif Basic arranges the analytics dashboards into several segments. The Overview screen shows a rundown of usage and state across your existing APIs, LLM proxies, and MCP servers in the specified time period. The individual analytics screens for each contain more information where you can also filter by specific APIs, LLM proxies, and MCP servers.

These are the different analytics dashboards that are available:

#### Analytics Overview

* Unique users  
* Total requests  
* Total errors  
* LLM traffic  
* MCP traffic  
* Overall platform metrics  
* Consumer onboarding trend  
* Top applications  
* Top APIs across platform  
* Traffic breakdown across APIs, LLM proxies, and MCP   
* Traffic intensity across hourly intervals each day  
* Top platforms and user agents  
* Average latency over time  
* Geographic heatmaps

The following image shows some of the dashboards in the **Overview** screen:
