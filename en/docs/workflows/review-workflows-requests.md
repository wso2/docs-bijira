# Review Workflow Approval Requests

In Bijira, administrators can [configure approvals for workflows](./configure-workflow-approvals.md) and assign specific users as approvers.

If you are assigned as an authorized reviewer for a particular workflow approval request, you will receive an email notification when a [request is submitted for approval](./submit-workflow-requests.md). The email includes a summary of the request.

!!! note
     - Workflow approvals are managed at the project level. If a role with the necessary permissions is assigned in a project context, only members of the user group bound to that role within the specific project will receive notifications for requests made in that project. For example, if you are assigned the Project Admin role (which includes the necessary permissions) for project A, you will only be notified of workflow requests within project A.
     - Users with organization-level permissions will receive notifications for all workflow requests across any project in the organization.

Other approvers within your organization will also receive notifications for workflow requests and may review a request before you. If a request has already been reviewed, it will appear under the **Past** tab on the **Approvals** page.

Approval requests are submitted on behalf of the team. Once approved, any authorized team member can execute the task. For certain tasks, execution may occur automatically upon approval.
