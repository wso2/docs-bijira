This is optional and may be included within the chain or provided separately.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates: Obtain these from the CA, if applicable.</li> <li>Root certificate: Obtain this from the CA.  If it is self-signed, it serves as the trust anchor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Combine the certificates into a single file in the following order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: This is your public certificate issued by the CA.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates if applicable: Include these in the correct hierarchical order.</li> <li>Root certificate: Include this at the end of the file. Use a text editor or a command-line tool to concatenate the certificates into one file, ensuring each certificate begins and ends with the proper markers. Also make sure the <code>BEGIN CERTIFICATE</code> and <code>END CERTIFICATE</code> markers appear on a new line: <pre><code> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Leaf Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Intermediate Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Root Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> <li>Save the concatenated file.

Typically, API consumers are most concerned with major API version alterations, but there might be instances where minor version changes are communicated to them.</p> <p>Therefore, in the context of deployment tracks, API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track.

Therefore, the changes you make to the policy stubs should reflect in the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. For example, if the policy is applicable only on the request and response paths, you can remove the  @mediation:FaultFlow annotation from the policy. Then, you MUST also remove the choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow keyword from the generated <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. If you do not do so, the Ballerina compiler will show an error at compile time.</p> Publish as a private custom policy <p>Bijira supports publishing a policy as a private custom policy. Publishing a policy as a private custom policy makes the policy inaccessible outside of the organization. To publish a policy as a private custom policy, change the visibility to <code>private</code> prior to pushing the package to Ballerina Central as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Open the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file of your policy. </li> <li> <p>Set the visibility to private by adding the configuration <code>visibility=\"private\"</code>. For example:</p> <pre><code>[package]\n   org = \"orgName\"\n   name = \"packageName\"\n   version = \"1.0.2\"\n   export = [\"packageName\"]\n   distribution = \"2201.5.5\"\n   keywords = [\"choreo-apim-mediation-policy\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-request-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-response-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow\"]\n   visibility = \"private\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Package and publish your policy to Ballerina Central.     </p> </li> </ol> Best practices <p>When implementing a policy, it is essential to follow best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. Here are some recommended best practices to follow:</p> <ul> <li>Organize the source code within the default module of the package. Do not add any additional modules.</li> <li>A policy implementation can contain any combination of flows. A generated project contains stubs for all three flows: <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code>, and <code>Fault</code>. You can remove any stub that you do not require. For example, when you create a policy that re-writes the resource paths, you can remove the <code>Response</code> and <code>fault</code> stubs. </li> <li>The HTTP request/response objects and context record parameters gets passed as references to the policy functions. Therefore, the changes you make to these values persist throughout the policy execution and are propagated to subsequent policies. This behavior allows the request and response objects to accumulate transformations applied by attached policies.</li> <li>Familiarize yourself with the different return types of policy flows. The following return types are unmodifiable:<ul> <li>http:Response - Returns an HTTP response when you terminate the mediation flow prematurely. For example,  in the in-flow sequence, the mediation sequence terminates before calling the backend. The mediation policy then sends an HTTP response to the client.</li> <li>false - Returns <code>false</code> if you want to terminate the mediation sequence with a predefined response (on the Bijira side).</li> <li>error - Returns an error if you want to terminate the mediation flow and transfer control to the fault flow. The fault flow would then construct an error response and send it to the client.</li> <li>() - Returns () to signal the successful completion of the policy. Once the proxy has completed executing the policy, it starts to execute the next policy in the sequence.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"develop-api-proxy/policy/attach-and-manage-policies/#step-3-publish-the-policy","title":"Step 3: Publish the policy","text":"<p>Once you implement a policy, you must publish it to Ballerina Central. </p> <p>When you attach a policy and deploy an API, Bijira pulls the necessary packages from Ballerina Central and bundles them into the mediation application under the hood.

This policy ensures that only authenticated clients with valid access tokens can access the API. The security header is configurable at the API level. This policy is enabled by default for every API resource, and can be disabled for individual resources by removing from the flow as necessary.</li> <li>Pass User Context to Backend: Forwards user-related information to the backend service under the header <code>x-jwt-assertion</code>. This policy ensures that user identity details are included in the request sent to the backend. In addition users can set end user token audiences. It is useful for enforcing authorization, logging, or customizing responses based on the authenticated user. This policy is only applicable at the API level.</li> <li>Rate Limiting: Restricts the number of API requests a client can make within a defined time window. Users can configure limits based on request count and time unit (e.g. 100 requests per minute). When the limit is exceeded, further requests are rejected with a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response. Users are able to set rate limiting thresholds at both API level and resource level.</li> <li>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Controls how resources on an API can be accessed from different origins. This policy allows users to configure <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>, <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code>, <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>, and <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code>. It ensures secure and flexible cross-origin requests, enabling APIs to be accessed from web applications running on different domains.

This is only applicable to the request flow and response flow mediation sequences. This policy assumes that the request/response payload is JSON. Attempting to use it on a request/response with a non-JSON payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow. For the same reason, this policy cannot be attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be an XML value.</li> <li>XML to JSON: Transforms a request/response with an XML payload to a request/response with a JSON payload. This policy assumes that the request/response payload is XML. Attempting to use it on a request/response with a non-XML payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow. For the same reason, this policy cannot be attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be a JSON value.</li> <li>Remove Query Parameter: Removes specified query parameters from a request. You can use this policy multiple times to remove different parameters. Attempting to remove a non-existent parameter has no effect. If the parameter exists, it will be removed; otherwise, the request proceeds as usual.</li> <li>Remove Header: Removes specified headers from a request or response. You can attach this policy multiple times to remove multiple headers. The header name must be static, but you can use placeholders to configure different values for different environments. For example, <code>${headerName}</code>.</li> <li>Add Query Parameter: Adds query parameters to a request. You can attach this policy multiple times to add various parameters. Adding the same parameter multiple times creates an array of values. The parameter name and value must be static, but you can use placeholders to configure different values for different environments. For example, <code>${fooValue}</code>.</li> <li>Add Header: Adds headers to a request or response. If the same header is added multiple times, values are appended rather than overwritten. The header name and value must be static, but you can use placeholders to configure different values for different environments. For example, <code>${authzHeaderValue}</code>.</li> <li>Set Header: Sets headers in a request or response, overwriting any existing values. You can attach this policy multiple times to set multiple headers. Each time the same header is set, it replaces the previous value. The header name and value must be static, but you can use placeholders to configure different values for different environments. For example, <code>${authzHeaderValue}</code>.</li> <li>Rewrite Resource Path: Modifies the resource path of an HTTP request by replacing the original path with a new relative path. You can apply this policy multiple times, but only the last instance will take effect. The new path must be static, but you can use placeholders to configure different values for different environments. For example, <code>${myResourcePath}</code>.</li> <li>Log Message: Logs the payload and headers of a request or response. Attaching this policy multiple times results in duplicate log entries. By default, headers and payloads are not logged. To log them, you can enable <code>Log Headers</code> and <code>Log Payload</code> parameters. To exclude specific headers when logging, you can use the <code>Excluded Headers</code> parameter, which takes a comma-separated list of header names. An error will occur if payload logging is enabled but the payload cannot be read.</li> <li>Permissions (Scopes): Defines fine-grained access control by assigning permissions (scopes) to API resources. Each resource can have one or more scopes, and only users or applications with the required scope in their access token can invoke the resource.</li> </ul> <p>These inbuilt mediation policies provide flexibility to manage API requests and responses, allowing for custom transformations and logic without requiring custom code.</p> <p>For details on attaching and managing one or more policies to an API proxy component implementation via the Bijira Console, see Attach and Manage Policies.</p>"},{"location":"devportal/developer-portal-mode/","title":"Developer Portal Mode","text":"<p>Bijira's developer portal can be configured in different modes based on your requirements.</p> <p>You can find this under the Configuration tab in the Developer Portal section in your organization's settings pane.</p> <p></p> <p>Devportal configuration has 3 modes.</p> <ol> <li>API Portal - In this mode, only API Proxies will be shown in the Devportal.
