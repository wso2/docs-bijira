For step-by-step instructions on constructing a certificate chain with a root certificate, click here    To construct a certificate chain with a root certificate, you must organize and combine the certificates in the correct sequence.

This is an optional certificate that may be included within the chain or provided separately. Follow these steps to construct the certificate chain:<ol> <li>Obtain and organize your certificates in the correct order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: The public certificate issued by the CA. This is optional and may be included within the chain or provided separately.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates: Obtain these from the CA, if applicable.</li> <li>Root certificate: Obtain this from the CA.  If it is self-signed, it serves as the trust anchor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Combine the certificates into a single file in the following order:<ul> <li>Leaf certificate: This is your public certificate issued by the CA.</li> <li>Intermediate certificates if applicable: Include these in the correct hierarchical order.</li> <li>Root certificate: Include this at the end of the file. Use a text editor or a command-line tool to concatenate the certificates into one file, ensuring each certificate begins and ends with the proper markers. Also make sure the <code>BEGIN CERTIFICATE</code> and <code>END CERTIFICATE</code> markers appear on a new line: <pre><code> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Leaf Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Intermediate Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n &lt;Root Certificate Content&gt;\n -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> <li>Save the concatenated file.

When working with service components in Bijira, it is important to have an effective API versioning mechanism. Bijira follows a versioning mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer) but only includes the major version and minor version with the prefix <code>v</code>.</p> <p>For example, <code>v1.2</code>.</p> <p>You can follow the approach given below when you version APIs in Bijira:</p> <ul> <li>Increment the major version when you make incompatible API changes.</li> <li>Increment the minor version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.</li> </ul> <p>What is Semantic Versioning?</p> <p>Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a specification that defines how to assign and increment version numbers for software products, including APIs. For more information, see Semantic Versioning specification.</p> <p>One of the primary concerns when dealing with SaaS APIs is to minimize disruption for API consumers while continuously developing and deploying updates.</p> <p>In compliance with SemVer, changes that don't introduce breaking or additive modifications to the API are categorized as patch updates. Hover, from the perspective of API consumers, these changes should ideally not disrupt their API clients. Typically, API consumers are most concerned with major API version alterations, but there might be instances where minor version changes are communicated to them.</p> <p>Therefore, in the context of deployment tracks, API developers only need to specify the major and minor versions being delivered from a particular deployment track. This information is treated as the API version attribute of a deployment track. If the publisher requires versioning for internal tracking purposes, this can be accomplished in Git through the use of Git tags, on GitHub with GitHub releases, and so forth.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"bijira-concepts/organization/","title":"Organizations in Bijira","text":"<p>Organizations are the foundational building blocks in Bijira, providing a secure and logical grouping of users, resources, and projects.

Therefore, the changes you make to the policy stubs should reflect in the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. For example, if the policy is applicable only on the request and response paths, you can remove the  @mediation:FaultFlow annotation from the policy. Then, you MUST also remove the choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow keyword from the generated <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. If you do not do so, the Ballerina compiler will show an error at compile time.</p> Publish as a private custom policy <p>Bijira supports publishing a policy as a private custom policy. Publishing a policy as a private custom policy makes the policy inaccessible outside of the organization. To publish a policy as a private custom policy, change the visibility to <code>private</code> prior to pushing the package to Ballerina Central as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Open the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file of your policy. </li> <li> <p>Set the visibility to private by adding the configuration <code>visibility=\"private\"</code>. For example:</p> <pre><code>[package]\n   org = \"orgName\"\n   name = \"packageName\"\n   version = \"1.0.2\"\n   export = [\"packageName\"]\n   distribution = \"2201.5.5\"\n   keywords = [\"choreo-apim-mediation-policy\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-request-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-response-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow\"]\n   visibility = \"private\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Package and publish your policy to Ballerina Central.     </p> </li> </ol> Best practices <p>When implementing a policy, it is essential to follow best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. Here are some recommended best practices to follow:</p> <ul> <li>Organize the source code within the default module of the package. Do not add any additional modules.</li> <li>A policy implementation can contain any combination of flows. A generated project contains stubs for all three flows: <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code>, and <code>Fault</code>. You can remove any stub that you do not require. For example, when you create a policy that re-writes the resource paths, you can remove the <code>Response</code> and <code>fault</code> stubs. </li> <li>The HTTP request/response objects and context record parameters gets passed as references to the policy functions. Therefore, the changes you make to these values persist throughout the policy execution and are propagated to subsequent policies. This behavior allows the request and response objects to accumulate transformations applied by attached policies.</li> <li>Familiarize yourself with the different return types of policy flows. The following return types are unmodifiable:<ul> <li>http:Response - Returns an HTTP response when you terminate the mediation flow prematurely. For example,  in the in-flow sequence, the mediation sequence terminates before calling the backend. The mediation policy then sends an HTTP response to the client.</li> <li>false - Returns <code>false</code> if you want to terminate the mediation sequence with a predefined response (on the Bijira side).</li> <li>error - Returns an error if you want to terminate the mediation flow and transfer control to the fault flow. The fault flow would then construct an error response and send it to the client.</li> <li>() - Returns () to signal the successful completion of the policy. Once the proxy has completed executing the policy, it starts to execute the next policy in the sequence.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"develop-api-proxy/policy/attach-and-manage-policies/#step-3-publish-the-policy","title":"Step 3: Publish the policy","text":"<p>Once you implement a policy, you must publish it to Ballerina Central. </p> <p>When you attach a policy and deploy an API, Bijira pulls the necessary packages from Ballerina Central and bundles them into the mediation application under the hood.
